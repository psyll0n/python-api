# A route to return all of the available entries that exist in the books database catalog. In the route we created, the book entries are
# converted from a list of Python dictionaries to JSON before being returned to a user. An SQL query is being run against the database in the
# code sample below.

# First, we connect to the database using our sqlite3 library. An object representing the connection to the database is bound to the conn variable.
# The conn.row_factory = dict_factory line lets the connection object know to use the dict_factory function we’ve defined, which returns items from the
# database as dictionaries rather than lists—these work better when we output them to JSON. We then create a cursor object (cur = conn.cursor()), which
# is the object that actually moves through the database to pull our data. Finally, we execute an SQL query with the cur.execute method to pull out all
# available data (*) from the books table of our database. At the end of our function, this data is returned as JSON: jsonify(all_books). Note that our
# other function that returns data, api_filter, will use a similar approach to pull data from the database.
